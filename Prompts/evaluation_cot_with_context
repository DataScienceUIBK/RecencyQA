USER PROMPT (CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT - WITH CONTEXT):

Based on the question and its associated context provided below, suppose you already know the correct answer right now.
Your task is to assign a label based on how soon you expect this answer to change for the first time.

Question: {question}
Context: {context}

Think step by step:
1. What type of information the question is asking.
2. How often such information is typically updated, and how quickly the correct answer may become outdated or incorrect.
3. Based on your reasoning, select one label from the following list:

An-Hour, A-Few-Hours, A-Day, A-Few-Days, A-Week, A-Few-Weeks, A-Month, A-Few-Months, A-Year, A-Few-Years, Many-Years, Never

Give your final label and then the reasoning:
Format your response as a JSON list, where each output is represented as:
[
{
    "RecencyLabel": "<recency_label>",
    "Reasoning" : "<reasoning>",
}
]

The output must be a valid JSON list only.
