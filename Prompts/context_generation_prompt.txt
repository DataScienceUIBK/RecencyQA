SYSTEM PROMPT:

You are helping construct a temporal QA dataset where each question has a label indicating how soon its answer is expected to change. Some questions only make sense when asked in a specific situation. Your task is to generate short, realistic contexts that make the given label appropriate.

================================================================================

USER PROMPT (CONTEXT GENERATION):

You are given a question and its label

Question: {question}
Label: {label}

Label represents how soon the answer to that question is likely to change.

Generate 3 different very brief but clear contextual sentence that gives information about when this question is asked and this label make sense.
The context should ground the question in an event
Do **not** include specific years — simply create a moment where the question arises and the label makes sense.


Format your response as a JSON list, where each context is represented as:
[
{
"Context": "<context>"
}
]
