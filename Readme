**How Often Do Answers Change? Estimating Recency Requirements in Question Answering**  
SIGIR 2026

---

## 📌 Overview

Large Language Models (LLMs) often answer time-sensitive questions using outdated knowledge. However, not all questions require the same level of freshness. Some answers change hourly, others yearly, and some never change at all.

**recencyQA** introduces a principled way to model this temporal behavior.

We propose a **Recency–Stationarity Taxonomy** and release **recencyQA**, the first dataset that explicitly annotates:

- ✅ Expected answer update frequency (**Recency**)  
- ✅ Context stability of that frequency (**Stationarity**)  
- ✅ Verified temporal contexts inducing different recency interpretations  

This enables fine-grained evaluation of temporal awareness in QA systems beyond binary “fresh vs outdated” distinctions.

## 🧠 Recency–Stationarity Taxonomy

We characterize temporal sensitivity along **two orthogonal dimensions**:

### 1️⃣ Recency (Expected Time Until Answer Changes)

12 discrete classes ranging from highly volatile to permanent:

| Class | Expected Change |
|-------|-----------------|
| An-Hour | Within an hour |
| A-Few-Hours | Within a few hours |
| A-Day | Within a day |
| A-Few-Days | Within a few days |
| A-Week | Within a week |
| A-Few-Weeks | Within a few weeks |
| A-Month | Within a month |
| A-Few-Months | Within a few months |
| A-Year | Within a year |
| A-Few-Years | Within a few years |
| Many-Years | After many years |
| Never | Not expected to change |

### 2️⃣ Stationarity

- **Stationary** → Recency class remains stable over time  
- **Non-Stationary** → Recency class depends on context  

Example:

- *Who is the CEO of X?* → Typically stationary  
- *Who is leading the Olympic medal table?* → Non-stationary
